  We would be happy if you would give feedback if this task was too difficult or too easy for you.
    = This task wasn't very difficult for me. Most of the time was spent learning the basics of Java, as I wasn't familiar with it before.
    I chose this language because your company works with it. I wanted to show you that I have a strong desire to learn new things, and I do it quickly.
